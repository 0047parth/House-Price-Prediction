**1. Introduction**
# House Price Prediction Flask App

## Overview

This project is a Flask web application designed to predict house prices based on input features. It uses a linear regression model trained on the Ames Iowa Housing dataset.

## Features

- *Predict house prices*: Use the trained model to get predictions based on various housing features.
- *Simple API*: Interact with the application using a RESTful API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip for package management

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

Certainly! Below is a sample README.md file that provides clear instructions for setting up, running, and using the Flask-based house price prediction application.

# House Price Prediction Flask App

## Overview

This project is a Flask web application designed to predict house prices based on input features. It uses a linear regression model trained on the Ames Iowa Housing dataset.

## Features

- **Predict house prices**: Use the trained model to get predictions based on various housing features.
- **Simple API**: Interact with the application using a RESTful API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` for package management

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction

**2. Install Dependencies**
Install the required Python packages using pip. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

**3. Train the Model**
Before running the application, you need to train and save the machine learning model. This can be done by executing the model.py script:

bash
Copy code
python model.py
This will create a house_price_model.pkl file containing the trained model.

**4. Run the Flask Application**
Once the model is trained, you can start the Flask web application by running:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application will start and be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Troubleshooting
Model File Missing: Ensure you have run model.py to generate the house_price_model.pkl file before starting the Flask app.
Dependency Issues: Make sure all required packages are installed. Check requirements.txt for the list of dependencies.
